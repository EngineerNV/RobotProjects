Summary of Projects 

Final Project is the Capture the Falg Project I performed with a team 
ReadMe inside of it explains the functions used in python 

Each project was a way to work up to the capture the flag game 


Project 1 Tracking showcases using CV feature detection to track a color object such as a stress ball
-This was used in the algorithm for chasing a color flag in CTF game 


Project 2 coverage  shows my algorithm of using a butler algorithm to sweep a predefined space to explore obstacles and map it 
to a grid based repersentation put inside a matrix in python 


Project 3 multi-agent - shows the use of a communication protocol I created for a team to send in Frames using Zigby wireless 
attenas. We use multi agent to play a simon says game where all robots switch playing as simon and give a random movement command
Trading Slave and Master between robots in a group
