Final Project

In order to run this program you have to have Python 3 installed. 

Here is the command to run it:

python3 RobotDefenseLine.py 

RobotDefenseLine.py contains the script that runs the commands needed to perform the 
defensive maneuver.

PWMrobotControl.py is the most recent motion control code to communicate with the microcontroller.

It is used in RobotDefenseLine.py.

PurpleTrack.py contains all the methods used for the robot's defensive behavior. 
There are five methods inside it: detectGoal(), trackingAlg(), block_thief(), aggressive_defense(),
and routine_defense().
