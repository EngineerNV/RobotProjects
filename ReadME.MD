Robotics 

PathFindingAndTracking - goal was to create a robot that is able to find its way through a maze and get towards its goal. Final Project was to create a Capture the Flag robot team 
Using visual cues to sense the end and IR sensors on the left, right, and front of the bot
-Other Goals included making multi-agent robots to create mapping of the environment and communicate to one client the information
of the obstacles its finds 

Ti Tiva Micro Projects 

These are example projects of me using microcontrollers with interrupts to gather information from Serial Ports and GPIO pins 
and collaborate with a raspi-pi with a UART communication protocol for mapping and localization. 


-Most Project Folders have Text readme explaining the project setups
